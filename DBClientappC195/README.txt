HOW TO RUN PROGRAM: When the program is initialized a login screen will display. The user is required to enter a valid user name and password
that matches information in a mySQL workbench database. Once a customer is validated the main menu screen will display. The Main Form button
consists of the bulk of the application for appointments and customers. The reports button will display the three report types. The exit
button will return the user to the login page and requires the user to re-enter valid credentials to access the application.

ADDITIONAL REPORT: For the custom report, I choose to display a filtered tableview per selected country. The user or
admin will make a selection of a country from the combo box which will filter the tableview with customers per country.
